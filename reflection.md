What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I tried putting most of the methods in the computer class but that did not work as expected so I added them to the ResaleShop Class.

I tried adding another computer to see if it would still work but the code did not work. It would add the new computer to the inventory but they both had the same index number. I tried creating a list of the indexes and relating the index of the computer in the inventory to its item id but then I realised that would not work because the index would change as computers were bought and sold. 

I tried adding an item counter but I declared the variable inside the class instead of outside so that didn't work. I eventually figured out I had to declare it outside of the ResaleShop class.

What Worked
I made the inventory a dictionary instead of a list and made the key the item_id from the item counter and the value a dictionary containing the information about the computer. Most of what worked was not my idea. I just replicated the functions given in the procedural_resale_shop file. By doing this I was able to keep the item_id from changing when something was deleted or added.


Advice: 
Make sure your code works for more than one use cases. 
Don't be afraid to google what you don't know.
Office hours are there for a reason and are extremely helpful.
Ask your peers for help.
